# How does it work?
I don't know, I just edit the oppai.c file because it's the only one that affects pp at all. But it theoretically should calculate the pp you get from a map based in it's .osu file

# How do I test it by myself?
- Download the pp fix version you wanna test [here](https://github.com/E-girl-Cansada/Kawata-pp-fix/releases)
- Copy the .osu files from the maps you wanna test to /maps
- Press CTRL-A (to select every map) and rename them to map. It will rename every map to map (1), map (2), map(n)... 
- Edit mapTesting.bat to the amount of maps you have (there's an example of how you should do it in the file)
- Run mapTesting.bat and see the results

# Planned fixes:
- High CS big nerf (reason: Aim correction)
- Low CS nerf (reason: Bad maps)

Those 2 nerfs will result in maps that goes from 5-6CS | 4-5CS with CS changer | after mods getting more pp than the rest. This is good because aim correction makes high CS maps very easy and low CS maps are trash so whatever

- Long map buff (reason: Avoid short compilation maps being broken, and also, the stream nerf is too harsh for some maps)
- Short map nerf (reason: Same as above)
- FL big buff (reason: No one uses it)
- An attempt to nerf jumps slightly (reason: helloisuck)
