# What is this?
An unofficial attempt to fix kawata.pw's STD relax pp system. Hopefully I get it to work and maybe it gets implemented in kawata

# How it works?
Idk, I just change oppai.c file cuz it's the only thing that matters... But it's supposed to calculate the pp for a map based in the .osu file of the same.

# How do I test by myself?
- Download this and extract where you wanna use it.
- Paste the .osu files of the maps you want to test in the folder called "maps".
- Edit mapTesting.bat (it should be self explanatory, but if you still need help, talk to me - E-girl Cansada#7777 - in Discord).
- Run mapTesting.bat and it should work.


# Hello, I'm a kawata dev, can I add those files to kawata's main repository?
No, at least I don't think so... cuz I made some edits in main.c, and idk if it will screw up something ingame, so like... I would recommend to only copy the oppai.c file to the repository.
