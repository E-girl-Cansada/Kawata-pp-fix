# What is this?
An unofficial attempt to fix Kawata!osu's relax PP system. Hopefully it works and perhaps it can be implemented in kawata...

# How does it work?
I don't know, I just edit the oppai.c file because it's the only one that affects pp at all. But it theoretically should calculate the pp you get from a map based in it's .osu file.

# How do I test it by myself?
- Download [this](https://github.com/E-girl-Cansada/Kawata-pp-fix/releases/download/0a/pp-fix-0a.zip)
- Copy the .osu files from the maps you wanna test to /maps
- Press CTRL-A (to select every map) and rename them to map. It will rename every map to map (1), map (2), map(n)... 
- Edit mapTesting.bat to the amount of maps you have (there's an example of how should you do it in the file)
- Run mapTesting.bat and see the results
